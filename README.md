It preserves source provenance, normalizes events into SQLite, retrieves evidence deterministically, and optionally asks MiniCPM5 through a local llama.cpp server to analyze retrieved records.<br><br>[Watch Locard's introduction video](https://youtube.com/shorts/UTP8ayRAmsk) <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>|


| Safeguard Mechanism | Description |
|---|---|
| Deterministic Extraction | Keeps the core evidence extraction process strictly deterministic. |
| Data Provenance | Preserves original evidence IDs and their sources throughout the analysis. |
| Context Bounding | Strictly limits and controls the context supplied to the model. |
| Citation Validation | Validates all citations made by the model to ensure they map to real evidence. |
| Clear Distinctions | Distinctly separates verifiable observations, correlations, and detections from AI-generated hypotheses and unknowns. |
| Execution Prevention | Strictly prevents the model from directly executing commands or querying the database. |


## Reminders

Evidence establishes facts. Model output is analysis, not evidence. Locard is an
investigative aid, not a replacement for validation by a forensic analyst.

SEMANTIC SIMILARITY != FORENSIC EVIDENCE. RAG helps locate evidence; it does not create evidence.

## Locard V6

**WARNING: This project is not finalized**

The interactive CLI in V6 uses the existing V0-V5 forensic capabilities. Even though this project is its in Version 6, which is supposed to be its final form, there is still a **lot** left to be done. At this stage Locard is a solution that did not pass the test of running in a live environment. It's more like and advanced prototype.

## Description
### Architecture and workflow

<img width="4152" height="2544" alt="locard-runtime (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54524163-8c67-45b6-ba56-9e4eb93881e5" />

### MiniCPM
Locard relies on the **MiniCPM5-2B** base model, which was created and released by OpenBMB (an open-source AI project team backed by ModelBest and Tsinghua University's Natural Language Processing Laboratory).  [https://github.com/openbmb/minicpm](https://github.com/openbmb/minicpm)
<img width="510" height="269" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d689307d-ddd5-42df-ba53-8a63d07339ad" />

MiniCPM5-2B is an incredible, highly optimized model. It packs capabilities typically reserved for much larger models (in the 4B–8B parameter range) into a lightweight 2.5B parameter footprint. This makes it perfectly designed for edge devices, laptops, and local agents. Despite its small size, MiniCPM5-2B punches well above its weight class. On benchmarking suites that measure tool calling, coding, and multi-step reasoning, it frequently matches or beats larger models like Qwen3.5-4B and Granite 4.2 3B, all while consuming a fraction of the VRAM.

By utilizing a small, efficient model like MiniCPM5-2B, Locard makes a fully local workflow practical. Analysts can run the system directly on their laptops without needing access to a massive GPU server. 

Locard does not need a massive general-purpose LLM because the AI is not responsible for uncovering the facts. The forensic facts are produced by deterministic parsers, database queries, correlation logic, and detection rules *before* the model is ever called. Locard deliberately prevents model intelligence from becoming part of the evidence chain, recognizing that simply increasing a model's size does not make its generated statements forensic evidence.

#### The Role of the AI Assistant

Locard does not ask the model to reconstruct an investigation from millions of raw events. Instead, deterministic retrieval and correlation reduce the case down to a small, bounded evidence bundle first.  The model serves as an analysis assistant layered on top of the forensic engine. **It is not the forensic engine itself.** 

| What MiniCPM DOES Do | What MiniCPM DOES NOT Do |
|---|---|
| Summarize retrieved forensic evidence. | Parse raw forensic artifacts. |
| Explain relationships between already identified records. | Generate or execute SQL queries. |
| Propose hypotheses and alternative explanations for observed activities. | Execute system commands. |
| Navigate the investigation alongside the analyst. | Modify evidence in any way. |
| Produce readable, evidence-backed analysis reports. | Decide which records constitute "forensic facts." |

### Locard inputs

Locard reads four types of forensic evidence files.

| File type | Examples | What Locard extracts |
| :---: |---|---|
| <img width="50" height="50" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3ca6ef2-fe73-4ece-8b72-c86ad66db30b" /><br>Windows event logs | .evtx, such as Security.evtx | Events, timestamps, accounts, processes, and other recorded fields |
| <img width="50" height="50" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1217ed71-79ad-4e78-8bce-b8de686b1a09" /><br>NTFS Master File Table | Extracted $MFT | File/directory metadata, filenames, parent references, sizes, and timestamps |
| <img width="50" height="50" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16469abf-fc15-4ca6-a520-0fc3f9181288" /><br>Windows Prefetch | .pf files | Executable names, recorded run counts/times, referenced filenames, and volume metadata |
| <img width="50" height="50" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6117fc9-f49e-49a7-bd04-c2a7f8b88bc2" /><br>Windows Registry hives | SYSTEM, SOFTWARE, SAM, SECURITY, NTUSER.DAT, UsrClass.dat | Keys, values, key last-write timestamps, and selected forensic artifacts |


Locard expects already extracted artifacts. It is not designed to run on the compromised machine (That would break the chain of custody). Moreover, Locard does not directly mount disk images such as E01, RAW, or VHD, parse memory dumps or packet captures, or analyze arbitrary PDF/Word documents. Registry transaction-log replay and SAM/SECURITY decryption are also unsupported. If your evidence is stored in a disk image, you can use an external forensic tool to mount or extract the filesystem before providing the relevant artifacts to Locard. See list below.

| Tool | Description | Repository |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ntfsdump** | Extracts files directly from NTFS disk images and supports formats including RAW, E01, VHD/VHDX, and VMDK. | [sumeshi/ntfsdump](https://github.com/sumeshi/ntfsdump?utm_source=gemini) |
| **imagemounter** | Python-based forensic image mounting utility supporting multiple forensic image formats through established forensic tools. | [ralphje/imagemounter](https://github.com/ralphje/imagemounter?utm_source=gemini) |
| **xmount** | Provides read-only access and conversion between forensic disk image formats including RAW, EWF/E01, VHD, VDI, and VMDK. | [mika/xmount](https://github.com/mika/xmount?utm_source=gemini) |



### Correlation, detections, and model context

| Status | Deterministic meaning |
|---|---|
| CONFIRMED | Explicit identity/linkage, such as a key containing a value; not a causation claim |
| CORROBORATED | Independent observations share an exact absolute path, known same host, and compatible timestamp fields |
| POSSIBLE | Partial object/name agreement with missing path, host, or timing support |
| UNRESOLVED | Conflicting host/path assertions, competing matches, incomplete object data, or candidate cap |


## How-to

### Platform support

Locard is currently developed and tested on Windows. Locard analyzes extracted Windows forensic artifacts and does not fundamentally require the source system to be Windows-mounted or live. Some underlying components are cross-platform, but Linux and macOS execution are not currently tested or officially supported.


### Run the local AI model

Run from your llama.cpp directory, adjusting the model path:

```powershell
llama-server.exe -m models\MiniCPM5-2B-Q4_K_M.gguf -ngl 99 -c 8192 --temp 1.0 --top-p 0.95 --min-p 0.0 --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```

The llama.cpp build must support JSON-schema response formatting. Citation fields
are constrained during generation to the exact evidence IDs supplied, then checked
again locally. This prevents typographical ID drift without trusting model citations.

Locard uses `POST /v1/chat/completions`, requests non-streaming JSON output, sets
temperature 0.2, disables thinking through the model chat template, and limits generation to 1024 tokens. It assumes an 8192-token
context, conservatively bounds the combined prompt to 5600 UTF-8 bytes, and does not
manage or download model weights. Model reliability and latency depend on your build,
chat template, and hardware. Ingestion and all deterministic commands work without it.

Only HTTP loopback addresses are allowed. `localhost` is mapped directly to
`127.0.0.1`; numeric IPv4 loopback and `::1` are supported. No DNS lookup, proxies,
redirects, telemetry, cloud services, or automatic execution of event content are used.
Ensure your local server itself is configured for local-only processing.


### Install 

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/jeanlucdupont/locard.git
cd locard
.\install.ps1
```

### Two modes

Locard can run with arguments or without arguments. Without argument, Locard switches to interactive (shell) mode.

```
.\locard.ps1
```
